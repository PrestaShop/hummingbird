        ### ❗️ Read this before submitting your bug report:
        - **Make sure that the problem is indeed related to Hummingbird theme.** To ensure your issue is dealt with as quickly as possible by QA and the community, it is important to make sure that the issue you create is in the right place!
        - **Write in English.** Reports in all other languages will be closed.
        - **Provide as much detail as possible** - error logs, screenshots, your exact configuration. If the issue cannot be reproduced, it cannot be fixed.
        - **Follow the [bug report guidelines](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/contribute/contribute-reporting-issues/#best-practices-for-writing-an-issue).** This will help issue managers qualify your report faster.
        - As explained [in this page](https://www.prestashop-project.org/security/sharing-third-party-distributions/), the team behind the project only maintains distribution under the official PrestaShop or PrestaShopCorp GitHub organizations. Please mention how you installed PrestaShop. If you used a third-party distribution and experience issues not reproducible with the official version, we might redirect you to that distribution's maintainers.
        - **Avoid reporting "error 500" or "white page" errors** - this is a universal error message that does not provide enough information to qualify the issue. Enable debug mode in the Performance section of PrestaShop or manually in `/config/defines.inc.php` and try again. You should get a proper error message.
